            <h2 data-supertitle="overview"> What is Flex Widgets</h2>
            <p> An app to let users create fully custom widgets with an array of design tools and
                information to display, right at their finger tips. </p>
            
            <h2 data-supertitle="role"> What I did in this project </h2>
            <p> My role in Flex Widgets was leading the product design of the app. <br/><br/>
                Yannik Schrade: developer and creator of Flex Widgets <br/>
                Nikias Molina: Marketing and initial video material for Flex Widgets </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="problem statement"> The user was forgotten </h2>
            <p> Flex Widgets was unintuitive; items to add were unclear, the app lacked visual hierarchy
                and segmenting, the look and experience of the app were unattractive and impractical. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="hypthesis and goals"> Satisfying expectations </h2>
            <p> By implementing all established default features users expect from an iOS app and
                categorizing the app’s functions into their respective segments Flex Widgets will enable
                users to utilize every part of Flex Widgets making it more inviting and fun to use. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="research"> It didn’t feel like an app </h2>
            <p> User research proved my initial reaction of the app right, it showed the empty space on
                the left drew too much attention or threw users off, the top selection falsely indicated a
                process to be followed and the app’s abilities were not represented. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="concepts"> A deep dive </h2>
            <p> Early on we decided Flex Widgets had the opportunity to stand out by polling the
                interface and making it stand out. I tried implementing all the new features and structures
                while exploring a neumorphic, dark, light and colored looks.</p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="solution"> What goes where </h2>
            <p> Flex Widgets needed a place to build the widgets and a place to finalize them. These
                became the editing and exporting personas. Editing has all the tools on the left, items
                below the widget/canvas and layers on the right. The exporting persona allows users to
                give the widget a name, save the theme of the widget so the next ones can look identical
                in style or share it online. </p>
