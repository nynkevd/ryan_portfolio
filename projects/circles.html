            <h2 data-supertitle="overview"> What is Circles</h2>
            <p> Circles is a social network that allows users to replicate their real-life social circles
                focussing on design and usability. </p>
            
            <h2 data-supertitle="role"> What I’m doing for Circles </h2>
            <p> I am the creator and designer of Circles. Currently in talks with developers to release the
                app in the App Store. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="problem statement"> Not re-inventing the wheel </h2>
            <p> Circles, being built on the basis of user’s frustrations of cluttered, unfocused, privacy
                intrusive (and sometimes with toxic traits) existing social media platforms tries to eliminate
                all of these while giving the experience of what social media was and can be a refreshing
                feel. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="hypthesis and goals"> Thinking outside the “box” </h2>
            <p> By giving users the ability to create custom “circles” as most do in real-life they get
                released from the pressure of sharing things with any (group of) people they might not
                feel comfortable with sharing. Cutting down on clutter and emphasizing social circles with
                natural forms of media will increase engagement and a personal connection with the app </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="research"> Social Media lacks a spark </h2>
            <p> User frustrations points show that my initial informal observations were mostly accurate
                and what potential additional features are. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="concept and solution"> Hyper-focus, circles. </h2>
            <p> Social circles were clear to become the main focus of Circles, a distinctive interface would
                be a requirement to separate it from the existing platforms. A bubbly interface with a lot of
                circles and rounded corners will make it obvious that a user is in the Circles app and
                communicate its philosophy at all times. </p>
