            </div>

            <h2 data-supertitle="overview"> What is Kernel</h2>
            <p> Early 2019, Kernel started as an idea to track the amount of days till a movie released in
                theaters. In July 2020 I became co-owner and scrapped everything we had in favor of
                building a better app from the ground up. Kernel becomes the central aspect of (socially)
                engaging with films and series. </p>
            
            <h2 data-supertitle="role"> What I did in this project </h2>
            <p> I was the only designer on this project and orchestrated the course of development as coowner
                with Nikias Molina, the founder of Kernel. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="Problems and ideas"> Index </h2>
            <ol id="index">
                <li> <a href="#watch-history"> People need a complete watch history </a></li>
                <li> <a href="#limited-experience"> Theatrical releases limit the experience </a></li>
                <li> <a href="#title-screen"> The neglected title screen </a> </li>
                <li> <a href="#multiple-titles"> Adding multiple titles is discouraging </a> </li>
                <li> <a href="#conclusion"> conclusion </a> </li>
            </ol>

            <span id="watch-history" aria-hidden="true"> </span>
            <h2 data-number="1" data-supertitle="problem statement"> People need a complete watch history </h2>
            <p> Kernel’s original list of tracked items were only theatrical released and were removed once
                they released. Leaving users clueless about wether they added it and naturally wether the
                title already released or not. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="hypthesis and goals"> Collections will elevate Kernel to a new level </h2>
            <p> Breaking the mold of a single list to track upcoming films will eliminate the lack of clarity.
                This transparency will increase engagement, retention and overall time spent in the app. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="research"> Competitors aren’t doing it (well) </h2>
            <p> I looked at competitors to see their user flows and pin point why this feature is not at its full potential yet. </p> 
            <br/>

            <div class="imagegrid">
                <div style="background-image: url('../images/kernelCase/stats.png')"> </div>
                <div data-title="Must" data-image="../images/kernelCase/must.png" style="background-image: url('../images/kernelCase/must.png')" onclick="openImage(this)"> </div>
                <div data-title="IMDb" data-image="../images/kernelCase/imdb.png" style="background-image: url('../images/kernelCase/imdb.png')" onclick="openImage(this)"> </div>
                <div data-title="Letterboxd" data-image="../images/kernelCase/letterboxd.png" style="background-image: url('../images/kernelCase/letterboxd.png')" onclick="openImage(this)"> </div>
            </div>

            <h2 data-supertitle="concepts"> Kernel only needs 1 button </h2>
            <p> This can be done. By giving users the ability to create custom collections of titles alongside
                a “want” and “seen” collection, letting users move titles out of a collection and into another
                on their own terms. </p>
            
            <img src="../images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder image"/>

            <h2 data-supertitle="solution"> Everything was a collection already </h2>
            <p> Titles one wants to see form a collection, Titles one has seen also form a collection
                together, likewise for any culmination thinkable. Hence Kernel will be moving forward with
                a prominent “add” button and icon to embody this idea. </p>
            <img src="../images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder image"/>

            <!-- CHAPTER 2 -->
            <span id="limited-experience" aria-hidden="true"> </span>
            <h2 data-number="2" data-supertitle="problem statement"> Theather limits the experience</h2>
            <p> Kernel originally only focused on theatrical releases however after those would release
                they disappeared from a list immediately. Global lockdowns made theatrical info useless
                and amplified the average viewers’ affection for series more than before. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="hypthesis and goals"> Remove to add </h2>
            <p> By shifting focus from theatrical releases for movies, and adding series, Kernel will appeal
                to more people. Additionally, a subtext which inherits the release date data to
                permanently go below the name of a title will show users only the information they need
                with a subliminal call to action. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="research"> Repeat to confirm </h2>
            <p> Only a minimal amount of users were interested in owning a digital or physical copy and
                would only track this information in limited situations. But the data showed there was
                more potential for the adaptive subtext. </p>
            <img src="../images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder image"/>
            <p> Tracking series can be done in multiple apps. No two reports from my group of testers
                who used competitive apps were the same. </p>
            <img src="../images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder image"/>

            <h2 data-supertitle="concepts"> Season 1, episode 3: subtext hierarchy </h2>
            <p> I included different categories from the previous research as categories for the subtext.
                These categories will be intuitively switched between following a hierarchy E.G. you can
                only rate a movie when you’ve seen it therefore availability is less relevant than seeing your
                existing rating. </p>
            <img src="../images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder image"/>
            <p> The majority of flaws in existing series tracking apps were already solved in the movie
                page, so series in Kernel were built on that. </p>
            <img src="../images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder image"/>

            <h2 data-supertitle="solution"> From the amount of days left to your personal rating </h2>
            <p> Series will be integrated using the same formula we developed for movies. And thus
                eliminate the need to use a different app with a learning curve for essentially the same
                functions. The adaptive subtext will be implemented and visible for all types of titles. </p>
            <img src="../images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder image"/>

            <!-- CHAPTER 3 -->
            <span id="title-screen" aria-hidden="true"> </span>
            <h2 data-number="3" data-supertitle="problem statement"> The neglected title screen </h2>
            <p> Kernel’s current form and any other film or series related app suffer from a crowded space
                on the title screen. This causes users to be discouraged to come back, look for more
                information the next time or lose track of what title the information was about in the first
                place as they keep scrolling. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="hypthesis and goals"> A visit that’s welcomed </h2>
            <p> A static page without horizontal scroll and the bare minimum of content will guide users
                where they are and can go. Providing this clear overview will improve retention rates by
                encouraging users to return for their next query. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="research"> Too much, too many, too long, too far, too small </h2>
            <p> This was an early, informal research and mostly included my personal insights. I later
                surveyed my test groups on these findings. Every element on these title pages is
                screaming for a user’s attention and get lost in the collective noise of the main title
                screens. </p>
            <img src="../images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder image"/>

            <h2 data-supertitle="concepts"> True to the intentions </h2>
            <p> Movie posters are designed to convey/recognize a film or series already, so they go front
                and center. A moving background blur could make the entire screen feel as if the app is
                part of the films and series. Grouped buttons with clear visual hierarchy should give clarity
                to the the rest of the screen. </p>
            <img src="../images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder image"/>

            <h2 data-supertitle="solution"> All for one </h2>
            <p> The large poster and matching background perfectly fit the philosophy of Kernel.
                Providing 5 lines of description by default fits most synopsis and can simply be expanded
                and closed. The actions unique to Kernel are prominently displayed underneath the
                synopsis. Buttons on the bottom of the screen neatly tuck away all information like
                episodes and seasons (only for series), complete cast & crew, and all trailers, teasers and
                behind the scenes that are publicly available in an uncompromising manner. </p>
            <img src="../images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder image"/>

            <!-- CHAPTER 4 -->
            <span id="multiple-titles" aria-hidden="true"> </span>
            <h2 data-number="4" data-supertitle="problem statement"> Adding multiple titles is discouraging </h2>
            <p> To keep users coming back they need to do more than a one time task. They might want to
                add every title they already kept track of, or know they’ve seen. But looking up every title
                one by one is a painstaking process. Much like adding contacts to a new phone or
                deleting social media posts. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="hypthesis and goals"> Make doing as easy as saying </h2>
            <p> Providing users with a way to search for titles inside of a collection and quickly add them
                by nothing more than tapping a “+” button will increase the amount of movies people
                add. Image recognition will make it easier for users to add titles from real life scenarios. </p>

            <h2 data-supertitle="research"> Needing an unnecessary break </h2>
            <p> One of the studies I performed on adding titles to “lists” in competing apps mostly ended
                in fatigue. In very few cases users actually felt satisfied with the results of the task they were set out to do. </p>
            <img src="../images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder image"/>

            <h2 data-supertitle="concepts"> Contributing to the future </h2>
            <p> Based on the test results a “quick add” feature would be accessed in a way similar to the
                mockups below. </p>
            <img src="../images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder image"/>

            <h2 data-supertitle="solution"> Let’s see what this is </h2>
            <p> When entering the “quick add” interface, users are likely to desire more control and add
                titles from the top of their head. The A.I. camera will be accessible from within quick add
                and the main search tab. So users can point their device at posters or covers and access
                what they want without having to do any work. </p>
            <img src="../images/placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder image"/>

            <span id="conclusion" aria-hidden="true"> </span>
            <h2 data-supertitle="Conclusion"> Empathy creates the bricks, perseverance is the cement. </h2>
            <p> What stuck to me the most is that there are no solutions. But only if you stop looking.
                Everything can be done, no exceptions. Understanding the user and truly being able to
                imagine oneself in the user’s situation is the easiest way of getting started and getting a
                sense of direction for the product. Preventing lot of potentially wasted time. Even more
                crucial than bricks and cement is a blueprint. The blueprint means breaking everything
                down to the core as if it were a building or a story. There’s an entrance, exit, and every
                room serves a purpose. If those blanks are filled in and make sense there’s a chance it’s a
                solid app.</p>
